		<p style="font-size: 35px; font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif;">Introduction</p><br><br>

		<b>Impact of technology while selling Bonsai plants</b><br><br>
		The government has utilized technology in two main areas. These include the facilitation of the delivery of citizen services and the improvement of defense and national security. The government is spending large sums of money on wireless technologies, mobile gadgets and technological applications. This is in an effort to improve their operations and ensure that the needs of citizens are fulfilled. The government uses technology to provide information and services to citizens. This encourages economic development and fosters social inclusion. Technology is also useful in improving national security and the safety of citizens. It integrates several wireless technologies and applications that make it easy for security agencies to access and share important information effectively. Technology is widely used by security agencies to reduce vulnerability to terrorism.<br><br>

		<b>Overall Conclusion</b><br><br>
		Technology has made significant contributions in the education sector. It is used to enhance teaching and learning though the use of different technological methods and resources. These include classrooms with digital tools such as computers that facilitate learning, online learning schools, blended learning and a wide variety of online learning resources. Digital learning tools that are used in classrooms facilitate learning in different ways. They expand the scope of learning materials and experience for students, they improve student participation in learning, they make learning easier and quick, and they reduce the cost of education. For example, online schools and free learning materials reduce costs that are incurred in purchasing learning materials. They are readily available online. In addition, it enhances learning because the problem of distance is eradicated and students can contact their teachers easily. Technology plays a significant role in changing how teachers teach. It enables educators to evaluate the learning abilities of different students in order to devise teachings methods that are most efficient in the achievement of learning objectives.<br><br>
		
		<b>Technology in business</b><br><br>
		Technology is used in the business world to improve efficiency and increase productivity. Most important, technology is used as a tool to foster innovation and creativity. Other benefits of technology to businesses include the reduction of injury risk to employees and improved competitiveness in the markets. For example, many manufacturing businesses use automated systems instead of manual systems. These systems eliminate the costs of hiring employees to oversee manufacturing processes. Another example of the use of technology in improving productivity and output is the use of database systems to store data and information. Many businesses store their data and other information in database systems that make accessibility of information fast, easy and reliable. Customers can shop for books or music on Amazon.com at any time of the day. E-commerce has given businesses the opportunity to expand and operate internationally.<br><br>


		<b>Negative impact of technology</b><br><br>
		Despite its many benefits, technology has negative impacts. It has negative impacts on the society because it affects communication and has changed the way people view social life. First, people have become more anti-social because of change in methods of socializing. Today, one does not need to interact physically with another person in order to establish a relationship.
		The internet is awash with dating sites that are full of people looking for partners and friends. The ease of forming friendships and relationships through the internet has discouraged many people from engaging in tradition socializing activities. Secondly, technology has affected the economic statuses of many families because of high rates of unemployment. People lose jobs when organizations and businesses embrace technology. For example, many employees lose their jobs when manufacturing companies replace them with automated machines that are more efficient and cost effective. Many families are struggling because of lack of a constant stream of income. On the other hand, technology has led to closure of certain companies because the world does not need their services. This is prompted by technological advancements.
		Video games have replaced physical activities that are vital in improving the health young people. Children spend a lot of time watching television and playing video games such that they have little or no time for physical activities. This has encouraged the proliferation of unhealthy eating habits that lead to conditions such as diabetes.<br><br><br>

		Now, talking about me I think I have more positive affect of technology than the negative affect. I am not saying technology does not have any negative affect in my life. Without technology I wouldnâ€™t have reached this position where I am now. Technology has helped me a lot to achieve the things that I have dreamed of. I always want to join the field of computer and technology. Without technology it would not have been possible. Due to help of google map I was able to visit different places of Kathmandu by myself when I visited Kathmandu for the first time. I am able to make my friends all over the world. Currently I have friends from India, USA, Indonesia, UK and Thailand. Different learning platform like YouTube, Udemy has helped me a lot to get extra information related to my college course. I am able to talk with my relatives who live inside or outside of Nepal. Also, it is technology that have connected you and me. You are able to read my blog because of technology. So, there are lots of things that makes me to think that technology have helped me a lot. Also talking about negative aspect of technology, there is a recent incident that happened with me. I was playing game while boiling milk in the kitchen. I was focused in my mobile in playing game that I forget I was boiling the milk. After some minutes my mother felt the burnt-smell coming from the milk. Then, she scolded me to be careful. You may not find this incident that much serious but what may have happened if my mother wasnâ€™t at home. This incident may happen in your house too. Likewise, sometimes I sit up to late night watching movies, series which affect my sleep and then next day I feel somewhat tired and lack focus on my work.<br><br>

		So, we must use technology in such a way that it will help and benefit us. We should not be fully addicted to the technology. We should control the technology, technology shouldnâ€™t control us. Thus, for the betterment and quality life we everyone must utilize the technology in positive way otherwise, bad accidents may happen.</span></p><br><button onclick="display()" id="myBtn">Read more</button>	<!--It will call the display function when we click on read more button-->
